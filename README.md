-Hi, I’m @LuigiBot! Interested in Machine Learning, Vision, and mostly anything new programming-wise. My background is mostly in the embedded side, with expertise in C/C++, but looking to expand my horizons.

- 🌱 I’m currently learning the Linux environment, and Python for Machine Learning.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any projects that are interesting and challenging.
